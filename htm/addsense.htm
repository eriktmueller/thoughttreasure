<H2>Adding Common Sense to Applications using ThoughtTreasure's Java-based client API</H2>
by Erik T. Mueller

<HR>
ThoughtTreasure is a treasure-house of pieces of common sense such as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Soda is a drink.<BR>
People have fingernails.<BR>
The sky is blue.<BR>
Dogs bark.<BR>
Someone who is 16 years old is called a teenager.<BR>
Rough synonyms for food are <em>foodstuffs</em>, <em>groceries</em>,
<em>chow</em>, and <em>grub</em>.<BR>
<em>Cassette</em> means cassette tape or cassette recorder.<BR>
Gold hair is called <em>blond</em> hair.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Though ThoughtTreasure's 100,000 items capture only a small portion
of human commonsense knowledge (probably on the order of 100,000,000
items!), a small amount of common sense can be useful in applications.
<P>
Previously ThoughtTreasure had to be linked into the application,
which was cumbersome. Starting with version 0.00021, ThoughtTreasure
can be run as a server. Now any application written in any language
can communicate with ThoughtTreasure over a TCP socket
connection. Multiple application instances can use a single server,
which can run on the same machine or any machine accessible over the
network.
<P>
This article describes how to use ThoughtTreasure in a calendar
manager application. We'll examine two programs written in Java using
ThoughtTreasure's Java-based client API. The first program guesses how
long an appointment will last, as a default initial value the user can
override. The second program determines where an object is typically
found, to provide a default location for an appointment or todo item.
<P>
To compile and run these programs, you'll first need to obtain
ThoughtTreasure and the Java-based client API. To compile and run
the server, you'll need a Unix box.
<H3>Guessing the length of an appointment</H3>
<P>
Listing One (located at the end of this article) shows the first
program, HowManyMinutesIs.java, which guesses the length of an
appointment in minutes. The program takes a single command-line
argument containing the natural language subject of the appointment as
entered by the user. Here are some sample runs of the program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "shave"
1.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "breakfast"
30.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "dog training course"
60.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "tennis w/Susanna"
150.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "surf the web"
60.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "dinner with Alex and Chris"
120.0
$ java HowManyMinutesIs "zzzz"
unknown
$
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <I>main</I> function starts by opening a connection to the
ThoughtTreasure server running on a machine called somehost and
listening on port 1832. To start the ThoughtTreasure server, you first
start ThoughtTreasure and then issue the server command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
$ ../bin/tt
ThoughtTreasure (gcc)
...
19990227T144310: reading ../db/elec.txt
19990227T144312: reading ../db/relation.txt
19990227T144313: Load time = 00:40.
* server -port 1832
19990227T144414: starting ThoughtTreasure server
19990227T144414: server started; port = 1832
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <I>guessEventLength</I> function first invokes the <I>tag</I> API
function to map lexical entries to objects.
<P>
A lexical entry is a word or phrase such as <I>surf</I> or <I>surf the
web</I>. An object represents a meaning of a lexical item. A lexical entry
may have several meanings. For example, <I>tag</I> maps the <I>surf the
web</I> lexical item to the <TT>surf-web</TT> meaning, and maps the
ambiguous <I>surf</I> to both <TT>surf-web</TT> and <TT>surf-waves</TT>.
<P>
A meaning may be expressed several ways. The <TT>surf-web</TT> object can
be expressed with <I>surf</I> and <I>surf the web</I> in English, as well
as <I>surfer</I> in French. ThoughtTreasure also includes lexical entries
for different dialects (American, British, Canadian, regional) and styles
(literary, standard, informal, slang).
<P>
The <I>guessEventLength</I> function continues by looping over each of
the meanings returned by <I>tag</I>, for lexical entries found
anywhere in the summary description of the calendar event. It
retrieves the typical durations of those meanings, and takes the
average. (No attempt is made to disambiguate the lexical entries.)
<P>
Here is how a typical duration is found: The <I>retrieve</I> API
function is invoked on the retrieval pattern:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
duration-of surf-web ?
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>surf-web</TT> is one of the meanings of a lexical entry
found in the input text. The question mark <TT>?</TT> is a wild card
that matches anything. In this case, the wild card will match the
duration value.
<P>
The fourth argument to <I>retrieve</I> is "anc", which specifies that
the function should move up ThoughtTreasure's object hierarchy on the
index 1, as specified by the second argument to <I>retrieve</I>. If
the duration of <TT>surf-web</TT> is not found, the duration of its
parent <TT>leisure-activity</TT> will be returned. If this is not
found, the duration of <TT>script</TT>, the parent of
<TT>leisure-activity</TT>, will be returned.
<P>
The first argument to <I>retrieve</I> is 2, which specifies that index
2 of the retrieved assertion should be returned, in this case the
duration. -1 can be used here if the entire assertion should be
returned.
<P>
The result of <I>retrieve</I> is something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[NUMBER 3600 secs]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
represented as a Java Object made up of Vector, String, and
Double. The <I>getMinutes</I> function is used to pick out the
duration from this Object and return it as a double in minutes.
<P>
In taking the average of the various retrieved duration values, any
duration greater than or equal to 720 minutes is thrown out since it
probably doesn't apply to a calendar appointment.
<P>
The <I>main</I> function prints out the result (or "unknown" if
nothing was found) and closes the connection to the ThoughtTreasure
server.
<H3>Determining where an object is typically found</H3>
<P>
Listing Two (located at the end of this article) shows the second
program, WhereDoIFind.java, which determines where a physical object
is typically found. The program takes a single command-line argument
containing natural language text describing a physical object. Here
are some sample runs of the program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
$ java WhereDoIFind "Tropicana orange juice"
A small city food store.
$ java WhereDoIFind "lettuce"
A small city food store.
$ java WhereDoIFind "minibar"
A hotel room.
$ java WhereDoIFind "runway"
A John F. Kennedy international terminal.
$
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <I>main</I> function opens a connection to ThoughtTreasure and
then invokes <I>whereDoIFind</I>, which invokes the <I>tag</I> API
function to convert the input text into ThoughtTreasure objects. The
<I>whereDoIFindObj</I> function is invoked on each object.
<P>
ThoughtTreasure contains a number of ASCII grids that represent
stereotypical locations such as a hotel room:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
==Park-Plaza-1E//
wwwwwwwwwwww    b:bed
wbbbbb    mw    d:lockable-door
wbbbbb     w    m:minibar
wx        Zw    w:wall
wwwwwwdddwww    x:phone
w               x:night-table
wwwwwwwwwwww    Z.wd:hotel-room
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This grid can be taken literally as a particular room in the Park
Plaza Hotel, or used to guess how any hotel room might be
arranged.
<P>
The key on the right specifies which objects are associated with which
characters: "w" represents a wall and "b" represents a bed. Contiguous
characters in the grid represent single objects. So there is only one
bed, which occupies all the cells containing a "b".
<P>
The hotel room is defined by filling a region of the grid. "Z.wd"
specifies to fill all cells reachable from the "Z" character without
going through a "w" (wall) or a "d" (door).
<P>
The <I>whereDoIFindObj</I> function starts by determining what grids
contain the given object. The <I>retrieve</I> API function is invoked
with the pattern:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
at-grid minibar
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where any descendants of <TT>minibar</TT> (types or instances of
minibar) are allowed to match. Assertions such as the following are
returned:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[at-grid minibar1934
         Park-Plaza-1E
         [GRIDSUBSPACE [NUMBER 1 u] [NUMBER 10 u]]]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
So far we know that a particular minibar (<TT>minibar1934</TT>) is
located in a particular grid (<TT>Park-Plaza-1E</TT>) in a particular
cell location (row 1, column 10). The <I>whatIsInGridAt</I> function
is invoked on that grid and cell location to determine what, if any,
other objects in the grid are present in the cell location.
<P>
The <I>whatIsInGridAt</I> function starts by retrieving all objects in
the given grid. Among them are <TT>lamp1924</TT> and
<TT>hotel-room1952</TT>. It invokes <I>isContainedIn</I> on each
object.
<P>
The <I>isContainedIn</I> function first retrieves the location of a
candidate enclosing object. For <TT>hotel-room1952</TT> the following
assertion is retrieved:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[at-grid hotel-room1952 Park-Plaza-1E [GRIDSUBSPACE ...]]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT>GRIDSUBSPACE ...</TT> includes all of the cells that
constitute the hotel room area. The function then tests whether any of
these cells is the same as the cell of the minibar. If so, it returns
true and <I>whatIsInGridAt</I> prints out the name of the enclosing
object. It invokes the <I>generate</I> API function to convert the
object name into English.
<H3>Other API functions</H3>
<P>
In this article I've shown how to use the <I>tag</I>, <I>retrieve</I>,
<I>generate</I>, and <I>close</I> methods of the TTConnection
class. The following other methods are provided:
<UL>
<LI><I>ancestors</I>: Returns the ancestors of an object.
<LI><I>bringdown</I>: Forces ThoughtTreasure to break out of the
server select loop, so that it can process further ThoughtTreasure
shell commands.
<LI><I>chatterbot</I>: Sends natural language input text to the
chatterbot and returns the natural language response.
<LI><I>children</I>: Returns the children of an object.
<LI><I>clearCache</I>: Clears the cache.
<LI><I>clearContext</I>: Clears the discourse context.
<LI><I>conceptToLexEntries</I>: Returns the lexical entries associated
with an object.
<LI><I>descendants</I>: Returns the descendants of an object.
<LI><I>ISA</I>: Tests whether an object is of a specified class.
<LI><I>isPartOf</I>: Tests whether an object is a part of another object.
<LI><I>parents</I>: Returns the parents of an object.
<LI><I>phraseToConcepts</I>: Returns the objects for a lexical entry.
<LI><I>semanticParse</I>: Semantically parses natural language text.
<LI><I>status</I>: Returns the status of the ThoughtTreasure server: "up"
or "down".
<LI><I>syntacticParse</I>: Syntactically parses natural language text.
</UL>
<P>
For information on how to use these other methods, see the complete
<A HREF="../java/doc/index.html">Java-based client API documentation</A>.
<H3>Summing up</H3>
<P>
As computing becomes more ubiquitous with the advent of the Internet,
it becomes more and more important for computers to understand the
human world. ThoughtTreasure presents a picture of this world to
computer programs. Using the Java-based client API or the socket
protocol, it is easy to make use of ThoughtTreasure's knowledge
base in applications.
